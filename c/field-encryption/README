This example demonstrates how to use field encryption API.

The application requires OpenSSL with development headers installed in the system.

* openssl_symmetric_provider.c: sample implementation of crypto provider.
  Note that it uses insecure way to store keys (i.e. hardcoded into binary).
  Production system have to use reliable and secure means for key management.

* openssl_symmetric_encrypt.c: sample application, demonstrating encryption of the
  documents

* openssl_symmetric_decrypt.c: sample application, demonstrating decryption of the
  documents

To try the example, use Makefile to build the binary and then execute it:

    $ make
    $ ./openssl_symmetric_encrypt couchbase://localhost password Administrator
    $ ./openssl_symmetric_decrypt couchbase://localhost password Administrator
